# Contributing to BDK

First, thank you so much for wanting to help out! If you need a place to start have a look if are any open [issues](https://github.com/bouvet/BouvetDevelopmentKit/issues) or open your own with bugs or feature requests. We are happy to take any improvements, both big and small.

## Development Environment

There are many ways to set up your environment to your liking, but if you don't know where to start, here is what we suggest:

1. Install the [required versions of Unity, Visual Studio, and the Windows SDK](https://github.com/bouvet/BouvetDevelopmentKit/tree/Martin-Readme-Design#supported-version)
2. Clone this repo locally
3. Create a new Unity 3D project and set up your [project settings](https://github.com/bouvet/BouvetDevelopmentKit/wiki/Getting-started#setup-project-settings)
4. Add BDK to your project using the package manager, but add the project from disk instead of from git
5. (Optional) Install [BDK Essentials](https://github.com/bouvet/BouvetDevelopmentKit/wiki/Essentials) to your project.

Now you can have fun playing around. You can change whatever you want in your Unity project, since only changes to the package will be added to the repo.

## Building and testing

We have a short [Build](https://github.com/bouvet/BouvetDevelopmentKit/wiki/Getting-started#building-for-the-hololens-2) guide on the wiki.
